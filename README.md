Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection

In modern medicine, neuroimaging provides an essential tool for physicians to diagnose intracranial injuries or diseases, such as tumors. Computer vision/ML models can be trained to assist medics and radiologists in analyzing patients' scans and their use is becoming more and more widespread. Using fastai we show how to train a convolutional neural network which can identify the presence of a tumor in a brain scan with an accuracy of over 99%.

Library that we needed :
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install opencv-python
